# This is a repository for the code written by me while studying in university
## Most of it is from years 2017-2019


["Frontend"](https://github.com/melamotome/code-from-uni/tree/main/frontend) folder contains simple (often one-page) websites made while learning HTML and CSS, also in-class and home work made while learning Javascript and its JQuery Library.


["Python and linguistics"](https://github.com/melamotome/code-from-uni/tree/main/Python%20and%20linguistics) folder contains code written in the process of learning basic python and using it for computational linguistics.


["Python, linguistics and machine learning"](https://github.com/melamotome/code-from-uni/tree/main/Python%2C%20linguistics%20and%20machine%20learning) folder contains code that uses Machine Learning for the problems of computational linguistics.


["Java"](https://github.com/melamotome/code-from-uni/tree/main/Java) folder contains 4 semester's worth of work learning Java.
<br/>Most memorable work project for me was an [application](https://github.com/melamotome/code-from-uni/blob/main/Java/Semester%203-4/fractals/DoFractal.java) each of us was making in the span of one semester that would draw the Mandelbrot fractal. In my application the user is able to control the image with arrows that allow viewing of different parts of the fractal and buttons + and - for changing the scale. Upon running the program one of those buttons should be pressed so that the fractal would be drawn the first time. The program is open for extension: there is a possibility to add more palettes of color that the fractal will be drawn with, also to add more buttons that the user can use, for example to change the palette.


["Haskell"](https://github.com/melamotome/code-from-uni/tree/main/Haskell) folder contains the code written while learning the basics of the Haskell programming language.
